Chapter 2 The Great Hamburglerization
	Colin is graciously partaking in the consumption of the legendary McRib, and Faith is dunking her Mcnuggets in the fabulous sweet and sour sauce. 
As Colin begins to shlop his large-soy-vannila-latte-extra-hot-whipped-cream-double-sleeve-no-cup beverage, he witness a (Mc)flurry of black and white. He
swiftly swings his head towards this bizarre occurance with a dropped jaw and wide eyes.
	"N-Nani?!" he mutters, "It's... It's the HAMBURGLER!!!"
	Colin leaps out of his dirty seat, Faith gazing at his shear will and manliness. He vaults over the counter, pushing the minimum-wage worker out of
the way. The hamburgler drops his tools and stares at Colin.
	"Bruh," exclaims The Hamburgler.
	Colin charges up a roundhouse kick to the jaw. As fast as a weeb recognizes a JoJo's reference, Colin's big strong steel-tipped boot makes contact
with the theif's weak chin, putting an end to his reign of terror. Little did Colin know, The Hamburgler wasn't acting alone.
